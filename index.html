<h3>Hi, my name is David Zapletal and I like programming, AV tech and powermetal.</h3>
<h3>Consider this page something between my personal blog and wiki for my projects</h3>

<p>Some info about me:</p>
<p>I am from Czech republic, i currently study at mathematic grammar school. I am interested in working with python and low level programming languages like assembly and C. One of my biggest projects ever is Crusader OS, an simple DIY operating system made from scratch. My first version wasn't pretty functional, and I didn't understand most of the functions so I made an completely different v02 which i'm currently working on. <a href="https://github.com/Daja201">My github</a> </p>
